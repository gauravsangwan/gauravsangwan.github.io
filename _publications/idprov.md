- Recent advancements in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made it possible to obtain high-quality face images of synthetic identities. These networks see large amounts of real faces in order to learn to generate realistic looking synthetic images. However, the concept of a synthetic identity for these images is not very well-defined. In this work, we verify identity leakage from the training set containing real images into the latent space and propose a novel method, IdProv, that uses image composition to trace the source of identity signals in the generated image.
