- Created a combination of Timeseries and Cross-sectional momentmum strategies to obtain a 1.2 Sharpe Ratio. 
- Conducted Intraday momentum crossover strategy research for effective Sharpe and NIFTY's seasonality momentum, which made me discover significant returns with a Sharpe Ratio of 1.38 when trading at 1015 hrs and 1435 hrs UTC +5:30.
- Cleaned and processed pricing data for all the 50 stocks which were covered under NIFTY.
- Constructed pair trading reversal strategy with NIFTY as one component, thus constructing trading signals based on residual returns from linear regression. 
- Combined all of the strategies based on their volatilites to generate a combined strategy with a back tested SR of 1.1 and IR of 0.78.
