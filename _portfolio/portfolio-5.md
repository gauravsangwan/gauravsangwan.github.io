Course project for **CSL7360 Computer Vision Course**

## This project is based on SIFT and how it can be used in multiple ways. Main Target problems are

- **SIFT for visual classification** : Using bag of visual words classfication technique
- **SIFT for adversarial Detection** : Using SIFT to detect if the input image is adversarially attacked or not.
- **3D Reconstruction and Localization** of monuments using uncaliberated stereo and image localization of the same monuments using their 3d reconstruction on any new image.
- **SIFT for Fingerprint matching**
- **SIFT for live webcam matching**
