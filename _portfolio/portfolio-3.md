1. **Statistical Arbitrage**:
   - Identified a solid mean-reverting relationship between NG1 and NG2 prices.
   - Generated a **Sharpe Ratio of 1.00**, indicating moderate risk-adjusted returns.
   - Maximum drawdown was **-10.61%**, with a recovery duration of 107 days.
   - Momentum strategies were mixed: **Time Series Momentum** delivered a **Sharpe Ratio of 1.35**, while **Cross-Sectional Momentum** performed poorly, with a negative Sharpe.

2. **Machine Learning Approach**:
   - Leveraged feature engineering combined with a random forest regressor model.
   - Achieved a **Sharpe Ratio of 9.05**, significantly outperforming the statistical approach.
   - Delivered higher cumulative returns, showing greater potential for profitability.

**Conclusion**:
While Statistical Arbitrage identified a strong price relationship with reasonable risk-adjusted returns, the Machine Learning strategy far exceeded expectations in terms of performance. However, to build a more robust and risk-managed trading strategy, a combination of the Machine Learning model with a risk-adjusted variant of the Statistical Arbitrage approach is recommended.
