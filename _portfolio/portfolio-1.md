- Developed a pairs trading reversal strategy across 100 cryptocurrencies, achieving a 1.89 backtested Sharpe ratio (net) and strong alpha generation.
- Cleaned and processed intraday pricing data for 300 cryptocurrencies from 2018-2024.
- Utilized correlationand cointegration analysis to identify highly correlated pairs, constructing trading signals based on residual returns from linear regression.
- Also, developed Cross-sectional and Time-Series Momentum strategies for the same, with a 1.43 backtested Sharpe ratio (net).
- Combined all of the strategies based on their volatilities to generate a combined strategy with a back tested SR of
1.6+ and IR of 0.9.
- Additionally also replicated [Deep Learning for Statistical Arbitrage](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04028.pdf) on crypocurrencies which helped in obtaining a Sharpe Ratio of 1.67, high-out-of-sample mean returns and also helped in lowering the transaction costs by 17%.
