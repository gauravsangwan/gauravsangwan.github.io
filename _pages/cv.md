**PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE**

**Research Consultant, World Quant Brain** | June 2023 – Present | Remote

- Implemented cross-sectional, seasonal-momentum strategies in US and CHN with 2.83 Sharpe ratio, 16.34% returns, and 34.06% turnover.
- Utilized advanced platform features: extended simulations, data visualizations, multi-simulation, SuperAlphas and Python API integration. Compensated based on algorithm quality.
- Engaged in mentorship under Stanislav Prokopyev (VP Brain Researcher).

**Software Engineer, Scale AI** | February 2024 – Present | Part-Time Remote

- Enhanced AI large-language models for data tasks through partnerships, improving performance and accuracy.
- Collaborated on code optimization and test cases for robust AI algorithms.
- Provided human feedback on LLM outputs to improve model performance and accuracy.
- Translated complex data problems into clear summaries for non-technical stakeholders, facilitating understanding of AI technology.

**PERSONAL QUANT PROJECT**

**Statistical Arbitrage in Cryptocurrencies**

- Researched a cross-sectional, long-short seasonal-momentum strategy in crypto with a back tested Sharpe of 0.8 and an information ratio of 0.7 after accounting for fees, commissions and expected slippage. Researched a reversal strategy based on "group-pairs" and residual returns from a multivariate regression
- Combined all of the strategies based on their volatilises to generate a combined strategy with a back tested SR of 1.6+ and IR of 0.9.

**Deep Learning Statistical Arbitrage([**Link**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04028.pdf))**

- Replicated and applied a statistical arbitrage framework to cryptocurrency markets, leveraging residual portfolios from conditional latent asset pricing factors to construct arbitrage portfolios. Implemented optimal trading policies based on these signals, achieving steadily high out-of-sample mean returns of 8.2% and Sharpe ratios exceeding 1.5, and lowered the transaction costs by 17%.
