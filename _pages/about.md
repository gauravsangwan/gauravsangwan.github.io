Hi there! I am **Gaurav Sangwan**, a <u>final year undergraduate</u> student majoring in <u>Artificial Intelligence and Data Science</u> at the Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur, I have developed a strong passion for **cutting-edge research and quantitative finance**.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **computer vision**, **hardware acceleration**, and **quantitative trading strategies**. I have published a peer-reviewed [paper](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/26942) at the prestigious AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and have two more upcoming publications in top-tier venues. My recent work has focused on developing secure and efficient hardware accelerators for vision transformers as well as exploring advanced signal combination techniques for enhancing the robustness of quantitative trading models.

Beyond academics, I have gained valuable industry experience through roles as a **Research Consultant** at <u>WorldQuant Brain</u> and a **Part-Time Software Engineer** at <u>Scale AI</u>. At WorldQuant, I implemented cross-sectional, seasonal-momentum strategies in the US and Chinese markets, achieving impressive Sharpe ratios. At Scale AI, I worked on optimizing and testing AI algorithms for large language models used in data tasks, while also serving as a diligent code reviewer.

I am **actively seeking opportunities** to further my passion for **quantitative research and quant trading**. I am driven by a constant desire to push the boundaries of what is possible through rigorous research and principled quantitative approaches. With a strong foundation in machine learning, econometrics, and mathematical modeling, I am well-equipped to tackle complex problems and deliver impactful solutions. I am excited to continue my journey as an aspiring researcher and quant strategist, contributing to the advancement of these dynamic fields.

If you have any exciting quantitative research or quant trading roles available, I would be thrilled to discuss how my skills and experience could be a valuable addition to your team.
