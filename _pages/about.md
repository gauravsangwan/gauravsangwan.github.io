👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur. My major is Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. 

🔬 My research interests are in Secure and Accelarated Computer Vision Hardware design and Quantitative Finance Research. 

📚 As of now, I have one published research work and two upcoming research works. 

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions

I have published a [paper](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/26942) at the 2023 Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (student abstract)

Moreover, I have submitted few more papers in top-tier conferences and journals which are expected to be published soon. 

<!-- ## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/). -->

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** in Department of Computer Science and Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Palash Das on **Secure and Accelearted hardware for Vision Transformers**.
Additionally, I have professional experience working as **Research Consultant** at WorldQuant Brain, in which I created mathematical models called alphas. I have also worked as **Software Engineering Intern** at ScaleAI as a part of their Bulba ICE Project.
