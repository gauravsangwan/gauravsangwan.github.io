Hi there! I am **Gaurav Sangwan**, a <u>recently completeled my (May 2024) undergraduate</u> degree majoring in <u>Artificial Intelligence and Data Science</u> at the Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur, I have developed a strong passion for **cutting-edge research and quantitative finance**.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **computer vision**, **hardware acceleration**, and **quantitative trading strategies**. I have published a peer-reviewed [paper](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/26942) at the prestigious AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and have three more upcoming publications in top-tier venues. My recent work has focused on developing secure and efficient hardware accelerators for vision transformers as well as exploring advanced signal combination techniques for enhancing the robustness of quantitative trading models.

I am **actively seeking opportunities** to further my passion for **quantitative research and quant trading**. I am driven by a constant desire to push the boundaries of what is possible through rigorous research and principled quantitative approaches. With a strong foundation in machine learning, econometrics, and mathematical modeling, I am well-equipped to tackle complex problems and deliver impactful solutions. I am excited to continue my journey as an aspiring researcher and quant strategist, contributing to the advancement of these dynamic fields.

If you have any exciting quantitative research or quant trading roles available, I would be thrilled to discuss how my skills and experience could be a valuable addition to your team. Please feel free to reach out to me at [gaurav.sangwan127@gmail.com](mailto:gaurav.sangwan127@gmail.com) or [sangwan.2@iitj.ac.in](mailto:sangwan.2@iitj.ac.in). 

# Professional Experience

<!-- Beyond academics, I have gained valuable industry experience through roles as a **Research Consultant** at <u>WorldQuant Brain</u> and a **Part-Time Software Engineer** at <u>Scale AI</u>. At WorldQuant, I implemented cross-sectional, seasonal-momentum strategies in the US and Chinese markets, achieving impressive Sharpe ratios. At Scale AI, I worked on optimizing and testing AI algorithms for large language models used in data tasks, while also serving as a diligent code reviewer.

In addition to above I have also worked as a **computer vision researcher** for Ayata Intelligence Private Limited under the supervision of [Sanchit Agarwal](https://github.com/SanchitAggarwal), in which I developed a novel federated learning powered IoT based Plant disease identification and Fruit Ripeness prediction system.  -->

My professional journey encompasses a diverse range of experiences in **quantitative research and data science**. 

At **WorldQuant Brain**, I implemented cross-sectional and seasonal-momentum strategies, achieving notable performance metrics in algorithm trading. As a **Software Engineer at Scale AI** (2024), I participated in their RLHF program for Bulba ICE. 

I have done **various research internships**, including a remote position with **Aalto University in Finland** (2022) under Prof. Rohit Babbar in domain of Extreme Multi-label Classification and a role in the **Materials Engineering department at IIT Jodhpur** (2021) under Prof. Abir Bhattacharya, working on **digital Image correlation** for various metallurgical application. 

Additionally, my [recent work](https://github.com/gauravsangwan/gauravsangwan.github.io/blob/master/files/thynaa.pdf) at **Thynaa Healthy Naturally** (2023) as **Data-Scientist** I designed and implemented an advanced federated learning-based framework for IoT applications, optimizing plant disease detection and fruit ripeness prediction with decentralized data processing for over 50k images everyday , demonstrating my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical, industry-specific challenges. 

Through this website, I invite you to explore my [research projects](https://gauravsangwan.github.io/portfolio/), [publications](https://gauravsangwan.github.io/publications/), and insights into the evolving landscape of quantitative finance and artificial intelligence. I welcome opportunities for collaboration and intellectual discourse in these exciting fields.
